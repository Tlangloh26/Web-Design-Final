    <h1>The Tragic Tales of Younger Siblings</h1>
<div class="wrapper">
  <p>Through out history younger siblings have been mistreated and neglected. This was even happening back in ancient history too. Younger siblings would get nothing, no inheritance, no attention, and only bullying from their older siblings. Today these patterns continue, although not quite as extreme. Younger siblings are often forgot about or receive to much attention from their parents. They are dragged along to their siblingsâ€™ events, less likely to get the front seat, less likely to get to drive the car, and still get bullied by their older siblings. Things are improving though, and there are even rare cases of siblings getting along, but today we will be looking at the tragic tales of three different younger siblings. </p>
