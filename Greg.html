  <p>Greg Hefley, the main character in A Diary of a Wimpy Kid, has some pretty horrible middle school stories largely due to him being wimpy, a younger sibling, and being very unlucky. Greg Heffley, however, is not a great kid. Greg can be cowardly, selfish, egotistical, and can even be very manipulative. Greg also somehow lacks almost any common sense at times. More on Greg’s’ wimpy aspect, Greg does not have great grades and seems to get more than a healthy amount of bulling, both at school and at home from his older brother Rodrick. Growing up with a older brother that hates him and loves to bully him could of definitely of caused Greg to be as wimpy as he is. Greg’s parents are not much help either. His mom is always trying to make him, and his brother get along, while his dad is always trying to make Greg more active because he is annoyed by Greg’s laziness. All these things work together to make Greg the wimpy younger brother he is.</p>
