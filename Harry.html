  <p>Although Harry Potter becomes an amazing, world saving, spell slinging, S-Tier hero, he was just a neglected younger sibling when we first meet him. He is not technically a Dursley, he grows up with him and they are his only family. The Dursleyâ€™s however are a really bad family. They hate Harry because he is an outsider, because he is different, and especially because he might have magic. Harry lives for years in some truly unlivable conditions. He is given less food than his brother Dudley, he is given old clothes that are way to big and ugly, he is given nothing for his birthday, Harry has to live in a closet under the stairs and has to follow all the whims and orders of his aunt, uncle, and even his cousin. Not to mention the beatings that Harry receives from Dudley and his friends. To them Harry is nothing more than a punching bag. Even after Harry starts to learn magic, he is locked in his room for a whole summer, with bars on his window and a lock on his door. Although things get much better, Harry Potter had a very rough childhood as a younger sibling.
