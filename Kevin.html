  <p>We all know the story of home alone and the amazing, crazy, and slightly terrifying adventures of 9-year-old Kevin McCallister, but its easy to forget what lead to those. Kevin was one of the youngest in a very large extended family, and therefore often drew the short straw when it came to just about everything. He was forgotten, had all the good pizza stolen from him then bullied about it, forced to apologize, and had to share a bed with the cousin that was known for peeing in his sleep. Kevin is bullied, mentally abused, verbally berated, and finally forgotten and left behind. Although he did wish for his family to disappear, he likely did not mean it. We have all wished for our families to disappear from time to time but never truly wish for it to happen. Kevin is left behind with burglars on his doorstep, and a creepy suspect serial killer right next door, all because he was a younger sibling.
